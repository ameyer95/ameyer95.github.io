About
------
I am a fourth-year Computer Sciences PhD student at UW-Madison, where I am co-advised by [Aws Albarghouthi](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~aws/) and [Loris D'Antoni](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~loris/). 

My work is motivated by the mismatch between machine learning's influence (and presumed authority), and the fact that many machine learning outcomes are arbitrary, i.e., not robust to small changes in the training data, training procedure, or test sample.

To that end, I have worked on certifying the robustness of machine learning models to small changes to the training data. I am also interesting in how we can adjust the training procedure for machine learning models so that the model explanations will be more robust. 

<!-- I graduated from Carleton College in 2018 with a BA in mathematics. Prior to starting grad school in the fall of 2020, I worked as a software developer at Epic in Madison. In my free time, I enjoy cooking (and eating!), Nordic skiing, reading fiction, running, and being outdoors.  -->
