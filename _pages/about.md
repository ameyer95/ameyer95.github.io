Hi, I'm Anna!
------
I am a Computer Sciences PhD student at UW-Madison, currently working with [Aws Albarghouthi](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~aws/) and [Loris D'Antoni](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~loris/). 

I am motivated by the question of how we can ensure that technology -- especially machine learning -- is deployed in fair, trustworthy, and socially responsible ways. In particular, my research looks at how to certify robustness for machine learning algorithms in the presense of data poisoning or bias.

I graduated from Carleton College in 2018 with a BA in mathematics. Prior to starting grad school in the fall of 2020, I worked as a software developer at Epic in Madison. In my free time, I enjoy cooking (and eating!), Nordic skiing, reading fiction, running, and being outdoors.
